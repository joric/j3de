  hey everyone...

  this is a PREVIEW of clax, my portable keyframing engine.
  it is 100% functional, but lacks a good documentation,
  and examples... only 1 'visual' example included, for watcomC/DOS
  platforms. i successfuly ran it under linux too, but lost the example.

  expect the final version in the start of august.

  greetings to adept, kombat, mali and memon for supporting this project
  (technical/moral support :)

  to compile an example (with watcom c) :
  
    chdir to src/
    type 'wmake -f makewc.mak' 
    copy clax.lib to examples/
    chdir to examples/
    type 'wcl386 test.c clax.lib /i=..\src' to compile the example
    it will produce test.exe , that will run 1.3ds in current directory,
    in 320x200x8bit mode.


  for any suggestions/questions/insults, send e-mail to borzom@hotmail.com

  and read the incomple docs in docs/ directory.
